# SUPERSIZE

SuperSize is an intuitive PvP multiplayer game similar to IO-style games like Agar.io or slither.io, where players must eat or be eaten to become the biggest on the map.

In SuperSIze, players spawn as blobs on a live map where their goal is to grow by eating smaller blobs and free food. Larger players move slower than smaller players but can spend tokens to boots forward and eat them. The goal of SuperSizeis to become the biggest on the map,so you can eat everyone, but no one can eat you.

SuperSize is designed from the ground up to support wager. Players can buy into a game and cash out at any time. Every SuperSize game runs using a token on Solana. Each player's score represents the amount of tokens they own.

Players can exit the game at any time and cash out their tokens after a 5 second delay. However, as players stay in the game and grow their blobs, the risk of getting eaten becomes lower, while the opportunity of blobs you can eat becomes greater. So even though players have the security of knowing they can cash out their tokens at any time, they are incentivised to stay and accelerate their growth.

SuperSIze is a simple,yet powerful game. This is because all of the game logic and state changes are recorded on the Lana blockchain in real time powered by Magic Block Engine. Every movement is executed as an on-chain transaction every 30 milliseconds.

SuperSIze is a magic block partner and one of the first projects that will launch their new low latency gaming engine. The trust less and secure nature of thebolckchain is critical for this high stake game. It affords users peace of mind against cheats and hacks while also giving this game superpowers behind the scenes.

Instead of hosting supersized game sessions on central servers that SVM access their central server. This reduces the cost for the host of each game to just a one-time deployment fee of about 0.1 sol. Building fully on chain also ensures maximum composability with a broader Solana ecosystem. This composability is important for supersizes plan to scale.

Supersize aims to bootstrap grow by providing token communities a fun way to engage their holders, which is a couple of clicks. Any token community on Solana can create and fund a supersized game using their token.

SuperSize's minimalist design makes it easy for user-generated content to feel natural to the game. Players can build with any token to create customized modern monetize their own supersized games.

SuperSize was developed over the past three months through the press start and sank to our capital on-chain gaming fellowship, which included a safe investment of $50,000.

SuperSize is live on DevNet, running Open Play Test Weekly for groups of 15-20 players in collaboration with the WAISD on-chain gaming guild.
SuperSize is launching at Islandow, and is set be the first game on mainnet using Magic Lock Engine.
